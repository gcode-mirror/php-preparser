First, you need to include the library file:

    include_once('Preparser/Preparser.php');

After doing this, just include other files using functions of Preparser namespace:

    Preparser\include('Preparser/test.php');
    Preparser\include_once('Preparser/test.php');
    Preparser\require('Preparser/test.php');
    Preparser\require_once('Preparser/test.php');

I recommend you create cache (yes of course it caches!!!1111)

    Preparser\setCachePath('preparserCache/');
    
In the other files (not in the ones which weren't included by Preparser, such as your main file with include_once('Preparser/Preparser.php')!) you can use all features which Preparser adds to PHP, such as Array Dereferencing:

    echo array(1, 2, 3)[2]; // '3'

As you can see in tests/dereferencing.php, you can use it with both functions and methods, static or not:

    $lol->get_lol()->get_ar()[ $lol->get_lol()->get_ar()[ $lol->get_lol()->get_ar()[ $lol->get_lol()->get_ar()[ 1 ] ] ] ]
    Lol::get_sar()[1]
    
Yeah, and namespaces are supported %)
